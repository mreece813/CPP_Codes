## Task

Write a program that uses `std::cout` and `std::cin` to ask the user "Enter a radius:". Use the radius to compute the volume and surface area of a sphere with that radius. Print the volume and the surface area on their own lines. Use a `double` for the radius. Use the following equations:

```
v = 4 * pi * r^3 / 3
a = 4 * pi * r^2
```

Where `v` is the volume, `a` is the surface area, and `r` is the radius. NOTE: include the `cmath` header and use `M_PI` for representing pi. The equations above are not valid C++ equations.

## Testing

Try testing the program with:

```shell
make test
```
