## Task

Write a program that uses `std::cout` and `std::cin` to ask the user "Enter an angle:". Convert the angle to radians, and the print out the value produced by calling `std::cos` on that converted angle - **nothing else should be printed**. NOTE: include the `cmath` header and use `M_PI` for representing pi. The equation to convert degrees to radians is given by: `r = d * pi / 180.0`, where `r` is radians and `d` is degrees.

## Testing

Try testing the program with:

```shell
make test
```
