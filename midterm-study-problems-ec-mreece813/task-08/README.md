## Task

Write a class called `ball` inside of `main.cpp` that has the following members:

* 1 `double` called `mass` with a default of `1.0`
* turn on the default constructor
* another constructor that takes in a `double` named `m` and sets the `mass`
* 1 function called `force` that takes as an input a `double` named `acceleration` and returns a `double`.
    * this function should return the product of `mass` and `acceleration`

## Testing

Try testing the program with:

```shell
make test
