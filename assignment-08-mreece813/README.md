Complete all tasks!

## Submit

Once you have all tests passing you are done with the assignment, and you just need to submit it. Run the following commands:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Finished tasks"
git push
```

The command `git add .` stages all of your changed files. Staging just means to identify which files we want to submit.

The command `git commit -m "Finished tasks"` takes the staged files and commits them to your project *local on your PC*. This creates an official record in git that the files have changed.

The command `git push` sends that official record to GitHub, which is where your

The message "Finished tasks" is the commit message. This is just informational and you can make it anything you want. Once you `git push` **check on your GitHub assignment repository** to ensure that your changes were submitted.
