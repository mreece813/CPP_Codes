# task-02

This basic program will take a user-supplied mass and use the famous energy-mass equation to calculate the energy-equivalence.

## Task

The energy-mass equation is as follows:

```text
E = mc^2
```

This states that an object with mass `m` has an energy equal to its mass multiple by the speed of light, `c = 300000000 m/s`, squared. Given some mass in kilograms, we want to compute its energy equivalence in Joules. Begin by creating a new file named `main.cpp` here in the task folder. Your program should make use of both `std::cout` and `std::cin` to ask the user for a side length. Then your program should calculate the surface area and then print it out, and then the same for volume.

When writing our code we want the program to very specifically ask the following question:

```text
What is your mass?
```

The spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are all very specific, so copy and paste that text as your output! Our program should use `double`s for storing our variables and should, and the result should be printed out on its own line, and **nothing more**.

Try building the program with:

```shell
make
```

## Running

Try running the program with:

```shell
./main.exe
```

Your program will ask for a side-length. Give it any number and observe the numbers that it produces.

## Testing

Try testing the program with:

```shell
make test
```
