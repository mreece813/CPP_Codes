# cpp-assignment-01-basic-programs

In this assignment we want to create a few very simple calculator programs:

* task-01: cube calculator
* task-02: mass-energy calculator
* task-03: temperature conversion calculator

## Setup

Accept the assignment from GitHub Classroom. You can find the link to the assignment from the [Student Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/ruc-sci-comp/teams/students) on GitHub.

Ensure that `turtleshell` is running via Docker on your PC and attach VS Code to it. Then clone this repository into `/root/home/turtleshell`. It is important to clone it to that directory, as that is where all of your saved data must go!

Now you are ready to begin, complete each task!

## Submit

Once you have all tests passing you are done with the assignment, and you just need to submit it. Run the following commands:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Finished tasks"
git push
```

The command `git add .` stages all of your changed files. Staging just means to identify which files we want to submit.

The command `git commit -m "Finished tasks"` takes the staged files and commits them to your project *local on your PC*. This creates an official record in git that the files have changed.

The command `git push` sends that official record to GitHub.

The message "Finished tasks" is the commit message. This is just informational and you can make it anything you want. Once you `git push` **check on your GitHub assignment repository** to ensure that your changes were submitted.
